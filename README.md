# Celo MarketPlace Front-End Project

- On this celo marketplace front-end project, developed for the Celo marketplace contract I have made a couple of improvements to the UI/UX, added new features and utilities as part of these improvements. Some of the key improvements made are the comment section, an approval process before a product purchase, a sort product utility, a product discount feature, and more. More details about these features below. 

- The Comment section basically was added for customers and product owners to make reviews on products
- The Approval before purchase process basically is a hook `useContractEvents` added to handle some edge errors keeping track of the userâ€™s purchase approval process asserting from logs there was an approval and provisioned allowance for the product purchase.
- The Sort Product utility is added to sort products in the preferred available order.
- The product discount feature is there basically for the product owner to apply discounts on products and enable or disable these features at will.
- Others
  - The `enablequery` state is an additional feature to the `useContractSend` hook to enable or disable the hook's automatic queries only when args or other requirements for a contract call are complete.
  - Also I added a `setTimeout` function to some function calls that depends on queries made before they could be successfully executed.
  - And a CRUD Modal.
